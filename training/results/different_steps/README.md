## Different minimum steps before learning rate drop

Drop learning rate at least after 100k/200k/400k/800k/1600k steps.

### Training settings

Except different epoch steps, all settings are default as in training code.

### Test settings

1600 playouts, no ponder, Leela Zero master branch engine.

![fig_2](../data_prepare/image/different_steps_2.png)  

### Conclusion 

- As the training steps become longer, the net is also stronger. 
- Even the result in loss and accuracy is similar in 800k and 1600k, the
  performance is quite different.
- The initial part of training result shows that the training procedure is
  quite reproducible.
