# Weights format

The weights file is a text file with each line containing a row of coefficients.
The layout of the network is as in the AlphaGo Zero paper, but any number of
residual blocks is allowed, and any number of outputs (filters) per layer,
as long as the latter is the same for all layers. The program will autodetect
the amounts on startup. The first line contains a version number.

* Convolutional layers have 2 weight rows:
    1) convolution weights
    2) channel biases
* Batchnorm layers have 2 weight rows:
    1) batchnorm means
    2) batchnorm variances
* Innerproduct (fully connected) layers have 2 weight rows:
    1) layer weights
    2) output biases

The convolution weights are in [output, input, filter\_size, filter\_size]
order, the fully connected layer weights are in [output, input] order.
The residual tower is first, followed by the policy head, and then the value
head. All convolution filters are 3x3 except for the ones at the start of the policy and value head, which are 1x1 (as in the paper).

There are 18 inputs to the first layer, instead of 17 as in the paper. The
original AlphaGo Zero design has a slight imbalance in that it is easier
for the black player to see the board edge (due to how padding works in
neural networks). This has been fixed in Leela Zero. The inputs are:

```
1) Side to move stones at time T=0
2) Side to move stones at time T=-1  (0 if T=0)
...
8) Side to move stones at time T=-7  (0 if T<=6)
9) Other side stones at time T=0
10) Other side stones at time T=-1   (0 if T=0)
...
16) Other side stones at time T=-7   (0 if T<=6)
17) All 1 if black is to move, 0 otherwise
18) All 1 if white is to move, 0 otherwise
```

Each of these forms a 19 x 19 bit plane.

In the training/caffe directory there is a zero.prototxt file which contains a
description of the full 40 residual block design, in (NVIDIA)-Caffe protobuff
format. It can be used to set up nv-caffe for training a suitable network.
The zero\_mini.prototxt file describes a smaller 12 residual block case. The
training/tf directory contains the network construction in TensorFlow format,
in the tfprocess.py file.

Expert note: the channel biases seem redundant in the network topology
because they are followed by a batchnorm layer, which is supposed to normalize
the mean. In reality, they encode "beta" parameters from a center/scale
operation in the batchnorm layer, corrected for the effect of the batchnorm mean/variance adjustment. At inference time, Leela Zero will fuse the channel
bias into the batchnorm mean, thereby offsetting it and performing the center operation. This roundabout construction exists solely for backwards
compatibility. If this paragraph does not make any sense to you, ignore its
existence and just add the channel bias layer as you normally would, output
will be correct.

# Training

## Getting the data

At the end of the game, you can send Leela Zero a "dump\_training" command,
followed by the winner of the game (either "white" or "black") and a filename,
e.g:

    dump_training white train.txt

This will save (append) the training data to disk, in the format described below,
and compressed with gzip.

Training data is reset on a new game.

## Supervised learning

Leela can convert a database of concatenated SGF games into a datafile suitable
for learning:

    dump_supervised sgffile.sgf train.txt

This will cause a sequence of gzip compressed files to be generated,
starting with the name train.txt and containing training data generated from
the specified SGF, suitable for use in a Deep Learning framework.

## Training data format

The training data consists of files with the following data, all in text
format:

* 16 lines of hexadecimal strings, each 361 bits longs, corresponding to the
first 16 input planes from the previous section
* 1 line with 1 number indicating who is to move, 0=black, 1=white, from which
the last 2 input planes can be reconstructed
* 1 line with 362 (19x19 + 1) floating point numbers, indicating the search probabilities
(visit counts) at the end of the search for the move in question. The last
number is the probability of passing.
* 1 line with either 1 or -1, corresponding to the outcome of the game for the
player to move

## Running the training

For training a new network, you can use an existing framework (Caffe,
TensorFlow, PyTorch, Theano), with a set of training data as described above.
You still need to contruct a model description (2 examples are provided for
Caffe), parse the input file format, and outputs weights in the proper format.

There is a complete implementation for TensorFlow in the training/tf directory.

### Supervised learning with TensorFlow

This requires a working installation of TensorFlow 1.4 or later:

    src/leelaz -w weights.txt
    dump_supervised bigsgf.sgf train.out
    exit
    training/tf/parse.py train.out

This will run and regularly dump Leela Zero weight files to disk, as
well as snapshots of the learning state numbered by the batch number.
If interrupted, training can be resumed with:

    training/tf/parse.py train.out leelaz-model-global_steps
